## Practices

- **Firebase Console**: Use the Firebase Console cautiously, as changes are permanent and immediately published.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Adopt trunk-based development:
  - **No Branching**: Work directly on the main branch to avoid complex merge conflicts.
  - **Pull Before Push**: Always pull the latest changes before pushing your code.
  - **Atomic Commits**: Make small, focused commits for each task. Every commit should be the smallest incremental change possible. Avoid doing multiple tasks in a single commit.
